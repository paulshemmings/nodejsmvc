nodejsmvc
=========

A first play at Node.js - thought I'd create a simple MVC framework. 

Allows you to drop in controllers and templates. 

Includes handlebars.js for client side templating.

To run:

1. Clone the code.
2. Install node.
3. Open terminal window.
4. node entrypoint.js
5. Open a browser to http://localhost:8099/home
